          STVS is a critical backend service that provides downstream systems with daily and weekly reports on stock valuations. Stock changes occurring on the shop floor are transmitted to the Stock API service via PDA devices, which then pushes this data into Kafka streams. Relevant JSON messages are filtered and stored in local NoSQL databases. These transactions are used to generate daily and weekly reports, which are consumed by downstream systems to assess stock levels.
